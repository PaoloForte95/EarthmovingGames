Games examples on earth-moving process 
This is a simple game on the earthmoving process. It is like a Sokoban game: a machine will move the material from a starting to a desired point inside the construction site. 

Below is possible to find several examples of this game.

The examples are developed through the PDDL. To run an example, follow the link and you will be redirected to a PDDL editor. Now press "Solve" and then "Plan". You will see the results of planning into the "Timeline Viewer".

Example 1: Simple Example -> 1 machine and 2 boxes.

Example 2: Complex Example -> 2 machines and 5 boxes. 2 different operations for moving the material: push and pull. The first machine can push the material while the second can pull it. Link: http://editor.planning.domains/#read_session=GMXCHL79wb

Example 3: Temporal Example -> Same Scenario of Example 2 but with durative actions (actions require a certain amount of time to be performed). Link: http://editor.planning.domains/#read_session=FHKezw6QwE
